# Doctors App Features
Once you log in, you will be taken to the homepage. As this is a partial implementation, only the nav bar and the Doctor‚Äôs button are currently available.

Click on Doctor and behold the doctor search bar! There, you can select a specialty and the corresponding doctors will be filtered and displayed for you. Select the doctor that you prefer.
The most important and elaborate part of this application is the booking system, in which every doctor has a totally independent set of available appointments. You can choose the date and time for the appointment and click Book. You will then be taken to a confirmation window and voila: your appointment is arranged.
